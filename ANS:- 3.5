QUESTION:-
1. Explain what is High availability of Namenode
2. Explain what is check pointing and how it is useful
3. Explain what is HDFS federation
4. What are the configuration files that are to be edited for sure while installing a hadoop cluster

ANS:-
1)The high availbility of name node emphasize that:-
                 1)There is a pair of NameNodes in an active-standby configuration.
                 2)In the event of failure of an active NameNode, the standby takes over its duties without a
                   significant interruption.
Hadoop 2.0 overcomes the problem by providing support for multiple NameNodes. It introduces Hadoop 2.0 High Availability 
feature that brings in an extra NameNode to the Hadoop Architecture which is configured for automatic failover.

Architectural Changes:
1) The NameNodes must use highly-available shared storage to share the edit log. Edit logs are
read by the StandbyNameNode when it takes the responsibility of the ActiveNameNode.
2) DataNodes must send block reports to both the NameNodes because of the block mappings.
3) The secondary NameNode’s role is subsumed by the StandBy NameNode. StandbyNameNode
takes periodic checkpoints of the active NameNode.
4)Checkpointing is done by the StandBy NameNode.

The main motive of the Hadoop 2.0 High Availability is to render availability to big data applications by deploying  
Hadoop NameNodes –
                       1)One in active configuration 
                       2)the other is the Standby Node in passive configuration.
                       
Hadoop 2.0 High Availability allows users to configure Hadoop clusters for NameNodes so as to eliminate the probability of 
Single point of failure in a given Hadoop cluster. The Hadoop Configuration capability allows users to build clusters horizontally with several NameNodes 
which can operat freely through a common data storage pool, thereby, offering better computing scalability when compared to Hadoop 1.0

EXAMPLE OF HIGH AVAILBILITY:-
Facebook is a fast growing large data organization that has close to 500 million active users who share more than 30 billion pieces of content on the web in the 
form of blog posts, photos, news stories, links, comments, etc. Approximately people spend 
700 billion minutes on Facebook per month and this data is said to double semi annually. Facebook uses Hadoop 2.0 High Availability feature to ensure that 
100 Petabytes of data is online with the use of the special AvatarNode.
AvatarNode has been contributed by Facebook as open source software to the Hadoop Community, to offer highly available NameNode that has hot failover and failback. 
AvatarNode is a double node or can be called as two-node cluster that provides a highly available NameNode to the Big Data applications with a manual failover.
AvatarNode is running heavy production workloads and contributes to improved administration and reliability of Hadoop Clusters at Facebook.

ANS:-
2) Checkpointing is an essential part of maintaining and persisting filesystem metadata in HDFS. It’s crucial for efficient NameNode 
recovery and restart, and is an important indicator of overall cluster health. However, checkpointing can also be a source of confusion 
for operators of Apache Hadoop clusters.

FILE SYSTEM METADATA IN HDFS:-
This filesystem metadata is stored in two different constructs: the fsimage and the edit log. The fsimage is a file that represents 
a point-in-time snapshot of the filesystem’s metadata. However, while the fsimage file format is very efficient to read, 
it’s unsuitable for making small incremental updates like renaming a single file. Thus, rather than writing a new fsimage 
every time the namespace is modified, the NameNode instead records the modifying operation in the edit log for durability. 
This way, if the NameNode crashes, it can restore its state by first loading the fsimage then replaying all the operations
(also called edits or transactions) in the edit log to catch up to the most recent state of the namesystem.
The edit log comprises a series of files, called edit log segments, that together represent all the namesystem modifications 
made since the creation of the fsimage.

HOW EXACTLY CHECK POINT LOOKS LIKE OR WORKS-
                  FS-IMAGE------------->
                                       ----------------->CHECKPOINTING----------->NEW FSIMAGE
                   EDITLOG------------->
CHECK POINTING WITH A STANDBY NAME NODE:-
The standby NameNode maintains a relatively up-to-date version of the namespace by periodically replaying the new edits 
written to the shared edits directory by the active NameNode.

CHECK POINTING WITH A SECONDARY NAME NODE:-
In a non-HA deployment, checkpointing is done on the SecondaryNameNode rather than the standby NameNode. Since there isn’t a shared 
edits directory or automatic tailing of the edit log, the SecondaryNameNode has to go through a few more steps first to refresh its
view of the namespace before continuing down the same basic steps.


ANS:-
3)HDFS FEDERATION:-
HDFS Federation improves the existing HDFS architecture through a clear separation of namespace and storage, enabling generic block 
storage layer. It enables support for multiple namespaces in the cluster to improve scalability and isolation. Federation also opens 
up the architecture, expanding the applicability of HDFS cluster to new implementations and use cases.

HDFS has two main layers:

Namespace manages directories, files and blocks. It supports file system operations such as creation, modification, deletion and listing of files and directories.
Block Storagehas two parts:
1)Block Management - it maintains the membership of datanodes in the cluster. It supports block-related operations such as creation, 
deletion, modification and getting location of the blocks. It also takes care of replica placement and replication.
2)Physical Storage- it stores the blocks and provides read/write access to it.

 :::Let HDFS contain two sub-directories in the root directory.
/usr
/share
1)In the HDFS Federation, there are multiple NameNodes, each storing the metadata and block
mapping of files and directories contained in particular sub-directories.

2)The list of sub-directories managed by a NameNode is called a namespace volume.

3)Blocks for files belonging to a namespace is called a block pool.
 
 For example, here we can have two namenodes, one for storing the metadata and block
 mapping for namespace volume /usr and one for /share.
